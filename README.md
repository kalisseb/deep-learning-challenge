# Deep Learning - Neural Networks


## Overview

In this analysis, I used Deep Learning Neural Networks to create a tool that will allow the nonprofit, Alphabet Soup, to identify which of their funding applicants have the best chance of success. A CSV file containing 34,000+ organizations that previously received funding via Alphabet Soup was provided for this analysis.

Libraries used:

sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

sklearn.preprocessing import standardscaler

pandas

tensorflow

tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

## Data Cleaning and Modeling

Full Details of the steps taken to clean the data and the details of each model are in "AlphabetSoupCharity_Report".

## Results

No model was able to reach the desired 75% Accuracy. The average accuracy of the initial training model and 3 additional models was 72.515%. The average loss was 56.695%.
